Libraries used in this project:
java.util.ArrayList

Concepts demonstrated in this project:
1.(Method Overriding)
 I have overridden toString function from the Object class  and I have provided my own definition.This function was implemented so that the output of the program is achieved in the desired format.  

2.(Encapsulation) 
Demonstrated encapsulation. To do this:
	a. All properties were made private so that any other POJO cannot access the properties directly.
	b. I have provided the getters to access the properties indirectly and setters for modifying the values of these properties.
	c. By using encapsulation we validate the values which are entered in the UI by the user in order to avoid the application being vulnerable to security attacks.
	
3.(Function Implementation and Function Invocation)
I have implemented a function called isEquals which will output whether two objects are equal or not.
